            <h3><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></h3>

Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with <u style="color: blue;">Charles Leiserson</u>, <u>Ron Rivest</u>, and <u>Cliff Stein</u>.For MIT 
Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about <u style="color: blue;">the secret to writing a best-selling textbook</u>.

Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>:

 Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about Introduction to Algorithms:

<i>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available?</i>
The fourth edition was released on 5 April 2022. The <u style="color: blue;">MIT Press site for the book</u> has links to sites that sell it.

<i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i>
For the fourth edition, we maintain an <u style="color: blue;">errata page</u> that allows you to list errors by date, by page, or by severity.
For the second and third editions, we maintained an <u style="color: blue;">errata page</u> that allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental update feature, allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about. We stopped logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.

<i>How do I report errors?</i>
First, please visit the <u style="color: blue;">errata page</u> to verify that the error has not been reported already. Once you have determined that you have found an unreported error, send email to clrs-bugs@mit.edu. We will respond as quickly as possible, often within a day.
Please use the <u style="color: blue;">xclrs-bugs@mit.edu</u> address only to report errors. If you have a suggestion or a question, please contact me directly at thc@cs.dartmouth.edu.

<i>Do you correct errors?</i>
Yes. Each time a new printing is produced, it contains corrections to all errors that have been reported by that time. 
The <u style="color: blue;">errata page</u> indicates in which printing each error was corrected.

<i>What is the difference between an edition and a printing?</i>
Each edition is a major revision of the book. The first edition of Introduction to Algorithms was published in 1990, the second edition came out in 2001, the third edition appeared in 2009, and the fourth edition is from 2022. A printing for a given edition occurs when the publisher needs to manufacture more copies. As the answer to the previous question indicates, we have been correcting errors in each printing of the second and third editions. We perturb the pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for a new printing.
Can I get solutions to exercises and problems?
As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for a select set of exercises and problems. They are posted at the MIT Press website.
We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is available only to instructors who have adopted the book for course use. The manual has lecture notes and solutions to additional exercises and problems, but by no means all of them. (I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises and problems would take somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.) You'll need to contact the MIT Press for passwords to access the manual site and the files. (Contact information is at the MIT Press website.) You cannot get the passwords from me or from any of my coauthors.

<b>I will not respond to requests for the manual or for solutions.</b>
